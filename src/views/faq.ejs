            This was a tough decision, but I ultimately decided to use full
            cards because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The card frame is most likely considered in WotC's art direction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Full cards are more recognizable and thus gives this app more
              general appeal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Having just art crops is an equally valid design choice, but to me
            just did not feel right.

            Card Art Voter uses an Elo rating system, similar to what's used in
            chess rankings. When you vote between two cards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The winning card's rating increases</li>
            <li>The losing card's rating decreases</li>
            <li>
              How much the ratings change depends on the current ratings of both
              cards
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The more you vote, the more accurate my rankings become!</p>

          <p>Artist and set rankings use a Bayesian average that considers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The average rating of the artist's or set's cards</li>
            <li>The number of cards by that artist or in that set</li>
            <li>
              A baseline rating that ensures artists/sets with very few cards
              aren't unfairly advantaged
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This provides a fair comparison between artists and sets with
            different numbers of cards in my database.

            Yes! The best way to contribute is simply by voting on more cards.
            The more votes my system has, the more accurate the rankings become.

          <p>
            The cards from the the Universes Beyond sets are not included since
            voters' bias against these sets were skewing the results. Voters
            could not separate their dislike of the sets from the art itself.
